# [Yandex.Music user activity log analysis](https://github.com/asolovov/asolovov_da_portfolio_en/blob/main/yandex_music/yandex_music_p_en.ipynb)

### The purpose of the reserch:
is to test three hypotheses:

- User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
- On Monday morning, some genres prevail in Moscow, while others prevail in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city.
- Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.

### Tools:

- Pandas

### Reserch Plan:

1. Introduction to data
2. Data preprocessing
3. Hypothesis testing
- Comparison of two capitals user behavior
- Auditions at the beginning and end of the week
- Genre preferences in Moscow and St. Petersburg
4. Research results

### Summary:

The day of the week has a different effect on the activity of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
The first hypothesis was fully confirmed.

Musical preferences do not change much during the week - be it Moscow or St. Petersburg.
Thus, the second hypothesis was only partly confirmed. This result could be different due to gaps in the data.

The tastes of users of Moscow and St. Petersburg have more in common than differences.
The third hypothesis was not confirmed.
