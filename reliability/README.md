# [Borrowers reliability research](https://github.com/asolovov/asolovov_da_portfolio_en/blob/main/reliability/reliability_en.ipynb)

### The purpose of the reserch:
It is necessary to find out whether the clients marital status and the number of children affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the research will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the reliability of a potential borrower.

### Tools:

- Pandas

### Reserch Plan:

1. Introduction to data
2. Data preprocessing
- Gaps
- Changing the data type
- Duplicates
- Categorization
3. Answers to the questions of the case
4. Research results

### Summary:

Deputies with children who are not married or in a cohabitation, as well as those who take loans for operations with a car and for education, more often do not repay loans on time than the rest by about 12-20%.

Divorced people, widowers and those who take out loans for home renovations are more likely to repay loans on time, this conclusion may be affected by a relatively small sample, a reserch on a larger sample is required.

The indicator of the income level rather does not or only slightly affects the repaying the loan on time probability.
